    - The tool requires you to put in some seed github users
    - It then uses the network of the github users to find new users
    - pulls information from github profile such as first name, last name and location
    - Opens a browser and looks up this person. Search string is First Name, Last Name and Location
    - If |search result| == 1, use this person
                -  Get a python repo (I think it is the smallest)
                -  Get the linkedin profile information (name, self promotion, work experience, education etc)
    - else move on
