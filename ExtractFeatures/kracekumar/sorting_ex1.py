**Multi-level sorting in Python.**

Problem:
    Suppose you have student tuple with elements name, age and grade. You got to
    sort them by age first and then by their grade.

Solution:
    It is easily accomplished by multi-level sorting using the *key* attribute
    of the sort function and using operator modules itemgetter function which
    can take multiple values.
