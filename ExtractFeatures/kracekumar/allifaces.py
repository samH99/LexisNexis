List Network Interfaces

**Purpose**: This program  provides list of network interfaces available on
your machine.

**Description**: man netdevice provides the following information about
SIOCGIFCONF which is used to retrieve the interfaces information.

SIOCGIFCONF

Return a list of interface (transport layer) addresses. This currently means
only addresses of the AF_INET (IPv4) family for compatibility. The user passes
a ifconf structure as argument to the ioctl. It contains a pointer to an array
of ifreq structures in ifc_req and its length in bytes in ifc_len. The kernel
fills the ifreqs with all current L3 interface addresses that are running:
ifr_name contains the interface name (eth0:1 etc.), ifr_addr the address.  The
kernel returns with the actual length in ifc_len. If ifc_len is equal to the
original length the buffer probably has overflowed and you should retry with a
bigger buffer to get all addresses. When no error occurs the ioctl returns 0;
otherwise -1. Overflow is not an error.
