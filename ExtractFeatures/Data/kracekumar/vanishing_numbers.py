"""
Some of reverse thinking is required.
Find numbers between 1/3 to 2/3 and return first.
Othewise, if the number is less than 1/3, multiple the number by 3 and see if
it falls between 1/3 to 2/3. Give the index of how many times you multiply.
For upper limit do, (number - upper) * 3 and see how many times you want to do.
If it does not fall,return a very high number.

Incorrect for large i/p.
